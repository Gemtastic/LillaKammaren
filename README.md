# Lilla Kammaren #
This is my first webapplication in Java, before I even knew how to 
SQL so there's a mock repository for items.

**This is the very first web application I've made**, and it's made 
using the Spring framework. I'm leaving it up here as a nostalgic 
piece.

## Web Shop ##
Lilla Kammaren is a web shop and full of newb mistakes as I made this 
last year. Feel free to leave reviews though, I love constructive 
code reviews.

I really went out of my way to make it using annontations.
